React is a single page App framework (SPA)
   After you fetch all the html all that gets sent back and forth are jsons
   React just loads and unloads components
    This helps with spotty network connections 
   But we want URL to change, and back button to work - this is react router

React Router
   This allows you to create routes that correspond to different components
   Even though this is still a single page app
